Introduction
------------

PanoptixNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes
support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems including Cisco,
Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and many more.

PanoptixNMS has grown out of a lack of easy to configure network monitoring platforms.
It is intended to provide a more navigable interface to the health and performance of
your network. Its design goals include collecting as much historical data about devices
as possible, being completely autodiscovered with little or no manual intervention,
and having a very intuitive interface.

PanoptixNMS is not intended to replace an up/down alerting system, but rather to
complement it with an easy to manage, intuitive representation of historical and
current performance statistics, configuration visualisation and syslog capture.
